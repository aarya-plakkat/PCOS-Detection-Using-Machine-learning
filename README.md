# PCOS-Detection-Using-Machine-learning

INTRODUCTION

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex hormonal disorder that affects millions of women of reproductive age across the globe. Beyond its well-known physical symptoms‚Äîsuch as irregular menstrual cycles, acne, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), alopecia (hair loss), weight fluctuations, and skin discoloration‚ÄîPCOS also poses significant emotional and psychological challenges, often impacting fertility, self-esteem, and overall quality of life.

Early and accurate detection of PCOS is critical to reducing long-term health risks, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and infertility. However, due to the syndrome‚Äôs diverse and often overlapping symptoms, timely diagnosis remains a challenge in many clinical settings.

To address this pressing need, our project introduces a machine learning‚Äìbased diagnostic support system designed to assist healthcare professionals in the early identification and prediction of PCOS. By analyzing key clinical parameters such as hormonal profiles, menstrual regularity, and reported symptoms, our system provides data-driven insights that support personalized therapeutic decisions.

We have implemented and evaluated four powerful machine learning classifiers:

üå≤ Random Forest (ensemble learning)

üìà Logistic Regression (statistical modeling)

üß† Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (probabilistic reasoning)

üìç K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (pattern recognition)

Each model has been rigorously trained and validated to ensure high accuracy and reliability in distinguishing between PCOS and non-PCOS cases. Through comparative analysis and performance metrics, we aim to identify the most effective model for clinical integration.

By leveraging artificial intelligence in women's healthcare, this project envisions a future where PCOS diagnosis is faster, smarter, and more accessible, paving the way for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.
